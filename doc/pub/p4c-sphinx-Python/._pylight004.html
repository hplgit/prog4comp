<p>We now turn our attention to solving mathematical problems through
computer programming. There are many reasons to choose integration as
our first application. Integration is well known already from high
school mathematics. Most integrals are not tractable by pen and paper,
and a computerized solution approach is both very much simpler and
much more powerful - you can essentially treat all integrals
<span class="math">\(\int_a^bf(x)dx\)</span> in 10 lines of computer code (!). Integration also
demonstrates the difference between exact mathematics by pen and paper
and <em>numerical mathematics</em> on a computer. The latter approaches
the result of the former without any worries about rounding errors
due to finite precision arithmetics in computers (in contrast to
differentiation, where such errors prevent us from getting a result as accurate
as we desire on the computer). Finally, integration is thought of
as a somewhat difficult mathematical concept to grasp, and programming
integration should greatly help with the understanding of what
integration is and how it works. Not only shall we understand how to
use the computer to integrate, but we shall also learn a series of
good habits to ensure your computer work is of the highest scientific
quality. In particular, we have a strong focus on how to write
Python code that is free of programming mistakes.</p>
<p>Calculating an integral is traditionally done by</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-eqn-fbfa">
\[\tag{2}
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a),\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x) = \frac{dF}{dx} \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The major problem with this procedure is that we need to find
the <em>anti-derivative</em> <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> corresponding to a given <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>.
For some relatively simple integrands <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>,
finding <span class="math">\(F(x)\)</span> is a doable task, but it can very quickly become challenging,
even impossible!</p>
<p>The method <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-eqn-fbfa"><span class="std std-ref">(2)</span></a> provides an <em>exact</em> or <em>analytical</em> value
of the integral. If we relax the requirement of the integral being
exact, and instead look for <em>approximate</em> values, produced by
<em>numerical methods</em>, integration becomes a very straightforward task
for any given <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> (!).</p>
<p>The downside of a numerical method is that it can only find an
approximate answer. Leaving the exact for the approximate is a mental
barrier in the beginning, but remember that most real applications of
integration will involve an <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> function that contains physical
parameters, which are measured with some error. That is, <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> is
very seldom exact, and then it does not make sense to compute the
integral with a smaller error than the one already present in <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another advantage of numerical methods is that we can easily integrate
a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> that is only known as <em>samples</em>, i.e., discrete
values at some <span class="math">\(x\)</span> points, and not as a continuous function of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
expressed through a formula.  This is highly relevant when <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is
measured in a physical experiment.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-ideas-of-numerical-integration">
<span id="sec-integrals-basic"></span><h2>Basic ideas of numerical integration<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-ideas-of-numerical-integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We consider the integral</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-integr-fofx">
\[\tag{3}
\int_a^b f(x)dx\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Most numerical methods for computing this integral split
up the original integral into a sum of several integrals, each
covering a smaller part of the original integration interval
<span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>. This re-writing of the integral is based on a selection of
<em>integration points</em> <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i = 0,1,\ldots,n\)</span> that are distributed on
the interval <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>. Integration points may,
or may not, be evenly distributed. An even distribution simplifies
expressions and is often sufficient, so we will mostly restrict ourselves to
that choice. The integration points are then computed as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-integr-points">
\[\tag{4}
x_i = a + ih,\quad i = 0,1,\ldots,n,\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-h-intgr-step">
\[\tag{5}
h = \frac{b-a}{n}\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Given the integration points, the original
integral is re-written as a sum of integrals, each integral being
computed over the sub-interval between two consecutive integration
points. The integral in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-sec-integr-fofx"><span class="std std-ref">(3)</span></a> is thus expressed as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-eqfdx">
\[\tag{6}
\int_a^b f(x)dx =
    \int_{x_0}^{x_1} f(x)dx + \int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x)dx + \ldots +
    \int_{x_{n-1}}^{x_n} f(x)dx\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(x_0 = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_n = b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proceeding from <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-eqfdx"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a>, the different integration methods will
differ in the way they approximate each integral on the right hand
side.  The fundamental idea is that each term is an integral over a
small interval <span class="math">\([x_i,x_{i+1}]\)</span>, and over this small interval, it makes
sense to approximate <span class="math">\(f\)</span> by a simple shape, say a constant, a straight
line, or a parabola, which we can easily integrate by hand. The
details will become clear in the coming examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="computational-example">
<h3>Computational example<a class="headerlink" href="#computational-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To understand and compare the numerical integration methods, it is
advantageous to use a specific integral for computations and graphical
illustrations. In particular, we want to use an integral that we can
calculate by hand such that the accuracy of the approximation methods
can easily be assessed.  Our specific integral is taken from basic
physics.  Assume that you speed up your car from rest and wonder how
far you go in <span class="math">\(T\)</span> seconds. The distance is given by the integral
<span class="math">\(\int_0^T v(t)dt\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(v(t)\)</span> is the velocity as a function of
time. A rapidly increasing velocity function might be</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-vcar-foft">
\[\tag{7}
v\left(t\right) = 3t^{2}e^{t^3}\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The distance after one second is</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-dcar-intgr">
\[\tag{8}
\int_0^1 v(t)dt,\]</div>
<p>which is the integral we aim to compute by numerical methods.
Fortunately, the chosen expression of the velocity has a form that makes it
easy to calculate the anti-derivative as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-sec-pcar-foft">
\[\tag{9}
V(t) = e^{t^3}-1\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>We can therefore compute the exact value of the integral as
<span class="math">\(V(1)-V(0)\approx 1.718\)</span> (rounded to 3 decimals for convenience).</p>

<p>Compared to the true answer of <span class="math">\(1.718\)</span>, this is off by about
10%. However, note that we used just 4 trapezoids to approximate the
area. With more trapezoids, the approximation would have become
better, since the straight line segments in the upper trapezoid side
then would follow the graph more closely. Doing another hand
calculation with more trapezoids is not too tempting for a lazy human,
though, but it is a perfect job for a computer! Let us therefore
derive the expressions for approximating the integral
by an arbitrary number of trapezoids.</p>
<p>For a given function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>, we want to approximate the
integral <span class="math">\(\int_a^bf(x)dx\)</span> by <span class="math">\(n\)</span> trapezoids (of equal width). We start out with
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-eqfdx"><span class="std std-ref">(6)</span></a> and approximate each integral on the right hand side
with a single trapezoid. In detail,</p>
<div class="math">

we can do it in a program. As always, a chunk of code doing a
particular thing is best isolated as a function even if we do
not see any future reason to call the function several times and
even if we have no need for arguments to parameterize what goes
on inside the function. In the present case, we just put the

special-purpose style, you have to retest the implementation of
the algorithm after every change of the program.</p>
<p>The present integral problems result in short code.
In more challenging engineering problems the code quickly grows
to hundreds and thousands of line. Without abstractions in terms
of general algorithms in general reusable functions, the complexity
of the program grows so fast that it will be extremely difficult
to make sure that the program works properly.</p>
<p>Another advantage of packaging mathematical algorithms in functions
is that a function can be reused by anyone to solve
a problem by just calling the function with a proper set of arguments.
Understanding the function&#8217;s
inner details is not necessary to compute a new integral. Similarly,
you can find libraries of functions on the Internet and use these
functions to solve your problems without specific knowledge of
every mathematical detail in the functions.</p>
<p>This desirable feature has its downside, of course: the user of a
function may misuse it, and the function may contain programming
errors and lead to wrong answers. Testing the output of downloaded
functions is therefore extremely important before relying on the
results.</p>

<p>Rather than approximating the area under a curve by trapezoids, we can
use plain rectangles. It may sound less accurate to use horizontal lines
and not skew lines following the function to be integrated, but
an integration method based on rectangles (the <em>midpoint method</em>) is in fact slightly more
accurate than the one based on trapezoids!</p>
<p>In the midpoint method, we construct a rectangle for every sub-interval
where the height equals <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at the midpoint of the sub-interval.
Let us do this for four rectangles, using the same sub-intervals as we
had for hand calculations with the trapezoidal method:
<span class="math">\([0,0.2)\)</span>, <span class="math">\([0.2,0.6)\)</span>, <span class="math">\([0.6,0.8)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\([0.8,1.0]\)</span>. We get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_0^1 f(t)dt \approx
   h_1 f\left(\frac{0 + 0.2}{2}\right) +

<h2>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Testing of the programs for numerical integration has so far employed
two strategies. If we have an exact answer, we compute the error and
see that increasing <span class="math">\(n\)</span> decreases the error. When the exact answer is
not available, we can (as in the comparison example in the previous
section) look at the integral values and see that they stabilize as
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> grows. Unfortunately, these are very weak test procedures and not
at all satisfactory for claiming that the software we have produced is
correctly implemented.</p>
<p id="index-20">To see this, we can introduce a bug in the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">application</span></code> function that calls <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoidal</span></code>: instead of
integrating <span class="math">\(3t^2e^{t^3}\)</span>, we write &#8220;accidentally&#8221; <span class="math">\(3t^3e^{t^3}\)</span>,
but keep the same anti-derivative <span class="math">\(V(t)e^{t^3}\)</span> for computing the
error.  With the bug and <span class="math">\(n=4\)</span>, the error is 0.1, but without the bug
the error is 0.2!  It is of course completely impossible to tell if
0.1 is the right value of the error. Fortunately, increasing <span class="math">\(n\)</span> shows
that the error stays about 0.3 in the program with the bug, so
the test procedure with increasing <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and checking that the error
decreases points to a problem in the code.</p>
<p>Let us look at another bug, this time in the mathematical algorithm:
instead of computing <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}(f(a) + f(b))\)</span> as we should, we
forget the second <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> and write <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.5*f(a)</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">f(b)</span></code>.  The error for
<span class="math">\(n=4,40,400\)</span> when computing
<span class="math">\(\int_{1.1}^{1.9} 3t^2e^{t^3}dt\)</span> goes like <span class="math">\(1400\)</span>, <span class="math">\(107\)</span>, <span class="math">\(10\)</span>,
respectively, which looks promising.  The problem is that
the right errors should be <span class="math">\(369\)</span>, <span class="math">\(4.08\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(0.04\)</span>. That is, the error should be reduced faster in the
correct than in the buggy code. The problem, however, is that it is
reduced in both codes, and we may stop further testing and believe
everything is correctly implemented.</p>

outcome of other tests. Typically, one algorithm

<h3>Solving a problem without numerical errors<a class="headerlink" href="#solving-a-problem-without-numerical-errors-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The best unit tests for numerical algorithms involve mathematical
problems where we know the numerical result beforehand. Usually,
numerical results contain unknown approximation errors, so knowing the
numerical result implies that we have a problem where the
approximation errors vanish. This feature may be present in very
simple mathematical problems. For example, the trapezoidal method is
exact for integration of linear functions <span class="math">\(f(x)=ax+b\)</span>. We can
therefore pick some linear function and construct a test function that
checks equality between the exact analytical expression for the
integral and the number computed by the implementation of the
trapezoidal method.</p>
<p>A specific test case can be <span class="math">\(\int_{1.2}^{4.4} (6x-4)dx\)</span>. This
integral involves an &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; interval  <span class="math">\([1.2, 4.4]\)</span> and
an &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; linear function <span class="math">\(f(x) = 6x-4\)</span>. By &#8220;arbitrary&#8221;
we mean expressions where we avoid the special numbers 0 and 1 since
these have special properties in arithmetic operations (e.g.,
forgetting to multiply is equivalent to multiplying by 1, and
forgetting to add is equivalent to adding 0).</p>

<div class="section" id="demonstrating-correct-convergence-rates-1">
<h3>Demonstrating correct convergence rates<a class="headerlink" href="#demonstrating-correct-convergence-rates-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<span class="target" id="index-23"></span><span class="target" id="index-24"></span><p id="index-25">Normally, unit tests must be based on problems where the numerical
approximation errors in our implementation remain unknown. However, we
often know or may assume a certain <em>asymptotic</em> behavior of the error.
We can do some experimental runs with the test problem <span class="math">\(\int_0^1
3t^2e^{t^3}dt\)</span> where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is doubled in each run: <span class="math">\(n=4,8,16\)</span>. The
corresponding errors are then 12%, 3% and 0.77%, respectively. These
numbers indicate that the error is roughly reduced by a factor of 4
when doubling <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Thus, the error converges to zero as <span class="math">\(n^{-2}\)</span> and
we say that the <em>convergence rate</em> is 2. In
fact, this result can also be shown mathematically for the trapezoidal
and midpoint method.  Numerical integration methods usually have an error
that converge to zero as <span class="math">\(n^{-p}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(p\)</span> that depends on the
method. With such a result, it does not matter if we do not know what
the actual approximation error is: we know at what rate it is
<em>reduced</em>, so running the implementation for two or more different <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
values will put us in a position to measure the expected rate and see if
it is achieved.</p>
<p>The idea of a corresponding unit test is then to run the algorithm for some <span class="math">\(n\)</span> values,
compute the error (the absolute value of the difference between the
exact analytical result and the one produced by the numerical method),
and check that the error has <em>approximately</em> correct asymptotic
behavior, i.e., that the error is proportional to <span class="math">\(n^{-2}\)</span> in case of
the trapezoidal and midpoint method.</p>
<p>Let us develop a more precise method for such unit tests based on
convergence rates.  We assume that the error <span class="math">\(E\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
according to</p>
<div class="math">
\[E = Cn^r,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is an unknown constant and <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the convergence rate.
Consider a set of experiments with various <span class="math">\(n\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(n_0, n_1, n_2, \ldots,n_q\)</span>.
We compute the corresponding errors
<span class="math">\(E_0,\ldots,E_q\)</span>.
For two consecutive experiments, number <span class="math">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(i-1\)</span>,
we have the error model</p>

<p id="index-26">The test procedures above lead to comparison of numbers for checking that
calculations were correct.
Such comparison is more complicated than what a newcomer might think.
Suppose we have a calculation <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">b</span></code> and want to check that the
result is what we expect. We start with 1 + 2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">expected</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we proceed with 0.1 + 0.2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">expected</span>
<span class="go">False</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p id="index-27">So why is <span class="math">\(0.1 + 0.2 \neq 0.3\)</span>? The reason is that real numbers cannot in
general be exactly represented on a computer. They must instead be
approximated by a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">floating-point number</a> that can only store a finite amount of information, usually about
17 digits of a real number. Let us print 0.1, 0.2, 0.1 + 0.2, and 0.3
with 17 decimals:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&#39;</span><span class="si">%.17f</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="si">%.17f</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="si">%.17f</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="si">%.17f</span><span class="s">&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">0.3</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">0.10000000000000001</span>
<span class="go">0.20000000000000001</span>
<span class="go">0.30000000000000004</span>
<span class="go">0.29999999999999999</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that all of the numbers have an inaccurate digit in the 17th
decimal place. Because 0.1 + 0.2 evaluates to 0.30000000000000004
and 0.3 is represented as 0.29999999999999999, these two numbers
are not equal. In general, real numbers in Python have (at most)
16 correct decimals.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-28"></span><p id="index-29">When we compute with real numbers, these numbers are inaccurately
represented on the computer, and arithmetic operations with inaccurate
numbers lead to small rounding errors in the final results. Depending on
the type of numerical algorithm, the rounding errors may or may not
accumulate.</p>
<p>If we cannot make tests like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.1</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">0.2</span> <span class="pre">==</span> <span class="pre">0.3</span></code>, what should we then do?
The answer is that we must accept some small inaccuracy and make
a test with a <em>tolerance</em>. Here is the recipe:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.3</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">computed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">b</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">diff</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">computed</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">tol</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1E-15</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">diff</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">tol</span>
<span class="go">True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here we have set the tolerance for comparison to <span class="math">\(10^{-15}\)</span>, but
calculating <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0.3</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">(0.1</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">0.2)</span></code> shows that it equals
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-5.55e-17</span></code>, so a lower tolerance
could be used in this particular example. However, in other calculations
we have little idea about how accurate the answer is (there could be
accumulation of rounding errors in more complicated algorithms),
so <span class="math">\(10^{-15}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(10^{-14}\)</span> are robust values.
As we demonstrate below, these tolerances depend on the magnitude of
the numbers in the calculations.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-30"></span><p id="index-31">Doing an experiment with <span class="math">\(10^k + 0.3 - (10^k + 0.1 + 0.2)\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,10\)</span> shows that the answer (which should be zero)
is around <span class="math">\(10^{16-k}\)</span>. This means that the tolerance must be larger
if we compute with larger numbers. Setting a proper tolerance therefore
requires some experiments to see what level of accuracy one can expect.
A way out of this difficulty is to work with <em>relative</em> instead of
<em>absolute</em> differences. In a relative difference we divide by one of
the operands, e.g.,</p>
<div class="math">
\[a = 10^k + 0.3,\quad b = (10^k + 0.1 + 0.2),\quad c = \frac{a - b}{a}\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Computing this <span class="math">\(c\)</span> for various <span class="math">\(k\)</span> shows a value around <span class="math">\(10^{-16}\)</span>.
A safer procedure is thus to use <em>relative differences</em>.</p>

Tests are placed in special <em>test functions</em>
that the frameworks can recognize and run for you. The requirements
to a test function are simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>the name must start with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_</span></code></li>
<li>the test function cannot have any arguments</li>

run all tests in all <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test*.py</span></code> files in all subdirectories, while
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nosetests</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">-v</span></code> restricts the attention to subdirectories whose

<p class="first admonition-title">Remark about version control of files</p>
<p>Having a suite of test functions for automatically checking that your
software works is considered as a fundamental requirement for reliable
computing. Equally important is a system that can keep track of
different versions of the files and the tests, known as a <em>version control
system</em>. Today&#8217;s most popular version control system is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>, which the
authors strongly recommend the reader to use for programming and writing
reports. The combination of Git and cloud storage such as GitHub is a
very common way of organizing scientific or engineering work.
We have a <a class="reference external" href="http://hplgit.github.io/teamods/bitgit/Langtangen_bitgit-bootstrap.html">quick intro</a> to Git and GitHub that gets you up and running within
minutes.</p>
<p>The typical workflow with Git goes as follows.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Before you start working with files, make sure you have the latest
version of them by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code>.</li>
<li>Edit files, remove or create files (new files must be registered
by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>).</li>
<li>When a natural piece of work is done, <em>commit</em> your changes by the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> command.</li>
<li>Implement your changes also in the cloud by doing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">A nice feature of Git is that people can edit the same file at the same
time and very often Git will be able to automatically merge the changes (!).
Therefore, version control is crucial when you work with others or when
you do your work on different types of computers.
Another key feature is that anyone can at any time view the history of
a file, see who did what when, and roll back the entire file collection
to a previous commit. This feature is, of course, fundamental for
reliable work.</p>

<p id="index-37">The functions <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">midpoint</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoid</span></code> usually run fast in Python

complicated implementations. To increase the speed, the loops
can be replaced by vectorized code. The integration functions constitute
a simple and good example to illustrate how to vectorize loops.</p>

<h3>Vectorizing the midpoint rule<a class="headerlink" href="#vectorizing-the-midpoint-rule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The aim of vectorizing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">midpoint</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoidal</span></code> functions is
also to remove the explicit loop in Python.
We start with vectorizing the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">midpoint</span></code> function since <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoid</span></code>
is not equally straightforward. The fundamental ideas of the vectorized
algorithm are to</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>compute all the evaluation points in one array <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code></li>
<li>call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(x)</span></code> to produce an array of corresponding function values</li>
<li>use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></code> function to sum the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(x)</span></code> values</li>
</ol>
<p>The evaluation points in the midpoint method are
<span class="math">\(x_i=a+(i+\frac{1}{2})h\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i=0,\ldots,n-1\)</span>. That is, <span class="math">\(n\)</span> uniformly
distributed coordinates between <span class="math">\(a+h/2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b-h/2\)</span>. Such coordinates
can be calculated by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">linspace(a+h/2,</span> <span class="pre">b-h/2,</span> <span class="pre">n)</span></code>.
Given that the
Python implementation <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></code> of the mathematical function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> works with
an array argument,
which is very often the case in Python,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(x)</span></code> will produce all the function values in an
array. The array elements are then summed up by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></code>: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum(f(x))</span></code>. This
sum is to be multiplied by the rectangle width <span class="math">\(h\)</span> to produce

<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx = \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Each of the integrals</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\]</div>
<p>can be discretized by any numerical
integration rule for an integral in one variable. Let us use the
midpoint method
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-sec-midpointformula"><span class="std std-ref">(22)</span></a>
and start with <span class="math">\(g(x)=\int_c^d f(x,y)dy\)</span>. We introduce
<span class="math">\(n_y\)</span> intervals on <span class="math">\([c,d]\)</span> with length <span class="math">\(h_y\)</span>. The midpoint rule
for this integral then becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy \approx  h_y \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} f(x,y_j),
\quad y_j = c + \frac{1}{2}{h_y} + jh_y \thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The expression looks somewhat different from <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-sec-midpointformula"><span class="std std-ref">(22)</span></a>,
but that is because of the notation: since we integrate in the <span class="math">\(y\)</span> direction
and will have to work with both <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> as coordinates, we must
use <span class="math">\(n_y\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(h_y\)</span> for <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, and the counter <span class="math">\(i\)</span> is more naturally
called <span class="math">\(j\)</span> when integrating in <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. Integrals in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> direction will use
<span class="math">\(h_x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n_x\)</span> for <span class="math">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(i\)</span> as counter.</p>
<p>The double integral is <span class="math">\(\int_a^b g(x)dx\)</span>, which can be approximated
by the midpoint method:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b g(x)dx \approx h_x \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} g(x_i),\quad x_i=a + \frac{1}{2}{h_x} + ih_x\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Putting the formulas together, we arrive at the <em>composite midpoint method
for a double integral</em>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx \approx
h_x \sum_{i=0}^{n_x-1} h_y \sum_{j=0}^{n_y-1} f(x_i,y_j)\nonumber\]</div>

<p>The formula <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-sec-int-double-midpoint-rule"><span class="std std-ref">(26)</span></a> can also be derived directly
in the two-dimensional case by applying the idea of the midpoint

<span class="math">\(n_x\times n_y\)</span> equal-sized cells. The idea of the midpoint method is
to approximate <span class="math">\(f\)</span> by a constant over each cell, and evaluate the constant

<div class="math">
\[[a+ih_x,a+(i+1)h_x]\times [c+jh_y, c+ (j+1)h_y],\]</div>

<p>How can we test that our functions for the double integral work?
The best unit test is to find a problem where the numerical approximation
error vanishes because then we know exactly what the numerical
answer should be. The midpoint rule is exact for linear functions,
regardless of how many subinterval we use.
Also, any linear two-dimensional function <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=px+qy+r\)</span> will be integrated
exactly by the two-dimensional midpoint rule. We may pick
<span class="math">\(f(x,y)=2x+y\)</span> and create a proper <em>test function</em> that can automatically
verify our two alternative implementations of the two-dimensional
midpoint rule. To compute the integral of <span class="math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> we take advantage of
SymPy to eliminate the possibility of errors in hand calculations.

<span id="sec-int-complex-domain"></span><h4>Monte Carlo integration for complex-shaped domains<a class="headerlink" href="#monte-carlo-integration-for-complex-shaped-domains" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<span class="target" id="index-45"></span><span class="target" id="index-46"></span><p id="index-47">Repeated use of one-dimensional integration rules to handle double
and triple integrals constitute a working strategy only if the
integration domain is a rectangle or box. For any other shape of
domain, completely different methods must be used. A common approach
for two- and three-dimensional domains is to divide the domain into
many small triangles or tetrahedra and use numerical integration
methods for each triangle or tetrahedron. The overall algorithm and
implementation is too complicated to be addressed in this book.
Instead, we shall employ an alternative, very simple and general method,
called Monte Carlo integration. It can be implemented in half a page of
code, but requires orders of magnitude more
function evaluations in double integrals compared to the midpoint
rule.</p>
<p>However, Monte Carlo integration is much more computationally
efficient than the midpoint rule when computing
higher-dimensional integrals in more than three variables over
hypercube domains.
Our ideas for double and triple integrals can easily be generalized
to handle an integral in <span class="math">\(m\)</span> variables. A midpoint formula
then involves <span class="math">\(m\)</span> sums. With <span class="math">\(n\)</span> cells
in each coordinate direction, the formula requires <span class="math">\(n^m\)</span> function
evaluations. That is, the computational work explodes as an exponential
function of the number of space dimensions.
Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, does not suffer from this
explosion of computational work and is the preferred method for
computing higher-dimensional integrals. So, it makes sense in a
chapter on numerical integration to address Monte Carlo methods, both
for handling complex domains and for handling integrals with many variables.</p>

<h3>The Monte Carlo integration algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#the-monte-carlo-integration-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The idea of Monte Carlo integration of <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x)dx\)</span> is to
use the mean-value theorem from calculus, which states that the
integral <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x)dx\)</span> equals the length of the integration
domain, here <span class="math">\(b-a\)</span>, times the <em>average</em> value of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\bar f\)</span>, in
<span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span>. The average value can be computed by sampling <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at
a set of <em>random</em> points inside the domain and take the mean of
the function values. In higher dimensions, an integral is estimated
as the area/volume of the domain times the average value, and again
one can evaluate the integrand at a set of random points in the domain
and compute the mean value of those evaluations.</p>
<p>Let us introduce some quantities to help us make the
specification of the integration algorithm more precise.
Suppose we have some two-dimensional integral</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_\Omega f(x,y)dxdx,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> is a two-dimensional domain defined via a help function
<span class="math">\(g(x,y)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Omega = \{ (x,y)\,|\, g(x,y) \geq 0\}\]</div>
<p>That is, points <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(g(x,y)\geq 0\)</span> lie inside <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>,
and points for which <span class="math">\(g(x,y)&lt;\Omega\)</span> are outside <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.  The
boundary of the domain <span class="math">\(\partial\Omega\)</span> is given by the implicit curve
<span class="math">\(g(x,y)=0\)</span>. Such formulations of geometries have been very common
during the last couple of decades, and one refers to <span class="math">\(g\)</span> as a
<em>level-set function</em> and the boundary <span class="math">\(g=0\)</span> as the zero-level contour
of the level-set function. For simple geometries one can easily construct
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> by hand, while in more complicated industrial applications one must
resort to mathematical models for constructing <span class="math">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)\)</span> be the area of a domain <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.
We can estimate the integral by this Monte Carlo integration method:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>embed the geometry <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> in a rectangular area <span class="math">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>draw a large number of <em>random</em> points <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> in <span class="math">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>count the fraction <span class="math">\(q\)</span> of points that are inside <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span></li>
<li>approximate <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)/A(R)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, i.e., set <span class="math">\(A(\Omega) = qA(R)\)</span></li>
<li>evaluate the mean of <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\bar f\)</span>, at the points inside <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span></li>
<li>estimate the integral as <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)\bar f\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that <span class="math">\(A(R)\)</span> is trivial to compute since <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is a rectangle,
while <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)\)</span> is unknown. However, if we assume that the fraction
of <span class="math">\(A(R)\)</span> occupied by <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)\)</span> is the same as the fraction of
random points inside <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>, we get a simple estimate for <span class="math">\(A(\Omega)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To get an idea of the method, consider a circular domain
<span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> embedded in a rectangle as shown below. A collection of
random points is illustrated by black dots.</p>

<h3>Verification<a class="headerlink" href="#verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A simple test case is to check the area of a rectangle <span class="math">\([0,2]\times[3,4.5]\)</span>
embedded in a rectangle <span class="math">\([0,3]\times [2,5]\)</span>. The right answer is 3,
but Monte Carlo integration is, unfortunately, never exact so it is
impossible to predict the output of the algorithm. All we know is that
the estimated integral should approach 3 as the number of random points
goes to infinity. Also, for a fixed number of points, we can
run the algorithm several times and get different numbers that fluctuate
around the exact value, since different sample points are used in different
calls to the Monte Carlo integration algorithm.</p>
<p>The area of the rectangle can be computed by the integral <span class="math">\(\int_0^2\int_3^{4.5}
dydx\)</span>, so in this case we identify
<span class="math">\(f(x,y)=1\)</span>, and the <span class="math">\(g\)</span> function can be specified as (e.g.)
1 if <span class="math">\((x,y)\)</span> is inside <span class="math">\([0,2]\times[3,4.5]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> otherwise.
Here is an example on how we can utilize the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MonteCarlo_double</span></code>
function to compute the area for different number of samples:</p>

<p>We see that the values fluctuate around 3, a fact that supports
a correct implementation, but in principle, bugs could be hidden
behind the inaccurate answers.</p>
<p>It is mathematically known that the standard deviation of the Monte Carlo
estimate of an integral converges as <span class="math">\(n^{-1/2}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number
of samples. This kind of convergence rate estimate could be used to
verify the implementation, but this topic is beyond the scope of this book.</p>

<span id="index-48"></span><h3>Test function for function with random numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#test-function-for-function-with-random-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To make a test function, we need a unit test that has identical
behavior each time we run the test. This seems difficult when random
numbers are involved, because these numbers are different every time
we run the algorithm, and each run hence produces a (slightly)
different result.  A standard way to test algorithms involving random
numbers is to <em>fix the seed</em> of the random number generator. Then the
sequence of numbers is the same every time we run the algorithm.
Assuming that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MonteCarlo_double</span></code> function works, we fix the seed,
observe a certain result, and take this result as the correct
result. Provided the test function always uses this seed, we should
get exactly this result every time the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MonteCarlo_double</span></code> function is
called. Our test function can then be written as shown below.</p>

<h3>Integral over a circle<a class="headerlink" href="#integral-over-a-circle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The test above involves a trivial function <span class="math">\(f(x,y)=1\)</span>. We should also
test a non-constant <span class="math">\(f\)</span> function and a more complicated domain. Let
<span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> be a circle at the origin with radius 2, and let <span class="math">\(f=\sqrt{x^2
+ y^2}\)</span>.  This choice makes it possible to compute an exact result: in
polar coordinates, <span class="math">\(\int_\Omega f(x,y)dxdy\)</span> simplifies to
<span class="math">\(2\pi\int_0^2 r^2dr = 16\pi/3\)</span>.  We must be prepared for quite crude
approximations that fluctuate around this exact result. As in the test
case above, we experience better results with larger number of points.
When we have such evidence for a working implementation, we can turn
the test into a proper test function. Here is an example:</p>

<p>In the code, we have taken the opportunity to show
how commenting often is used to switch between two
code fragments, typically single statements. The
alternatives <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">100</span></code> are switched by
removing/adding the comment sign <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></code>, before running
the code anew. Another alternative would of course be
to ask the user for the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>.
Running the program with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code>, produces the following printout:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>For n = 2, we get:

<p>We consider integrating the sine function: <span class="math">\(\int_0^b \sin (x)dx\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Let <span class="math">\(b=\pi\)</span> and use two intervals in the trapezoidal and midpoint method.
Compute the integral by hand and illustrate how the two numerical
methods approximates the integral. Compare with the exact value.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
Analytically, the integral computes to 2. By hand, with the trapezoidal method,
we get 1.570. Graphically (Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-intgr-sine-a-trap"><span class="std std-ref">The integral computed with the trapezoidal method (n = 2)</span></a>), it is clear that
the numerical approach will have to under-estimate the true result.</p>
<p>The area under the blue graph in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-intgr-sine-a-trap"><span class="std std-ref">The integral computed with the trapezoidal method (n = 2)</span></a>
corresponds to the &#8220;true&#8221; area under the graph of the integrand. The area
under the red graph corresponds to what you get with the trapezoidal method and
two intervals.</p>

we might see that the numerical approach will have to over-estimate the true result.

</div>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
Do a) when <span class="math">\(b=2\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
Analytically, the integral computes to zero. In this case, both numerical methods will correctly calculate the integral to zero even with just two intervals! Graphically, we see that they arrive at zero for &#8220;different reasons&#8221;. The trapezoidal method constructs both its trapezoids by use of the function (integrand) value at the midpoint of the whole interval. However, there the integrand crosses the x-axis, i.e. it evaluates to zero. The &#8220;area&#8221; computed by the trapezoidal method becomes the zero area located &#8220;between&#8221; the green graph and the x-axis in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-intgr-sine-b-trap-mid"><span class="std std-ref">The integral computed with the trapezoidal and midpoint method (n = 2)</span></a>. The midpoint method computes the areas of two rectangles (red graph in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-intgr-sine-b-trap-mid"><span class="std std-ref">The integral computed with the trapezoidal and midpoint method (n = 2)</span></a>), but since the signs of these equal areas differ, they add to zero.</p>

<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
Note that also the midpoint method will do an exact (to within machine precision)
integration when the integrand is a straight line. This is so, since the errors
from each rectangle will cancel. The code reads:</p>

property was used in the test function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_trapezoidal_linear</span></code> in the file
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_trapezoidal.py</span></code>. Change the function used in
the section <span class="xref std std-ref">sec:integrals:testprocs</span> to <span class="math">\(f(x)=6\cdot 10^8 x - 4\cdot 10^6\)</span>
and rerun the test. What happens? How must you change the test
to make it useful? How does the convergence rate test behave? Any need
for adjustment?</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
With the new function given, we get the error message that includes:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>AssertionError: n = 2, err = 9.53674e-07
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The numerical calculation then obviously differs from the exact value by
more than what is specified in the tolerance <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tol</span></code>. We may understand this
by considering the new function, i.e., <span class="math">\(f(x)=6\cdot 10^8 x - 4\cdot 10^6\)</span>.
Any rounding error in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> will get magnified big time by the factor <span class="math">\(6\cdot 10^8\)</span> in front,
i.e. the slope of the line. This makes the numerical calculation more inaccurate than previously.
To fix this problem, we have several options. One possibility is to relax the tolerance, but
this is not very satisfactory. After all, the calculation is supposed to be &#8220;exact&#8221; for a straight
line. Another alternative is to introduce a new integration variable such
that we scale the interval <span class="math">\([a,b]\)</span> into <span class="math">\([\frac{a}{6\cdot 10^8},\frac{b}{6\cdot 10^8}]\)</span>, as
this will neutralize the huge factor in front of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, bringing the accuracy back to where it was previously. This
alternative is implemented in

<p>A third alternative is to use the module <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decimal</span></code> that comes with Python, which
allows number precision to be altered by the programmer. An alternative,
better suited for numerical computing, is the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpmath</span></code> module in SymPy (since
it supports standard mathematical functions such as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sin</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cos</span></code> with
arbitrary precision, while <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">decimal</span></code> can only the standard arithmetics with
arbitrary precision).</p>

<p>We want to test how the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoidal</span></code> function works for the integral
<span class="math">\(\int_0^4\sqrt{x}dx\)</span>. Two of the tests in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_trapezoidal.py</span></code>

using 2 or 3 trapezoids and modify the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_trapezoidal_one_exact_result</span></code>

<p>The convergence rate test fails. Printing out <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r</span></code> shows that the
actual convergence rate for this integral is <span class="math">\(-1.5\)</span> and not <span class="math">\(-2\)</span>.
The reason is that the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule#Error_analysis">error in the trapezoidal method</a>
is <span class="math">\(-(b-a)^3n^{-2}f''(\xi)\)</span> for some (unknown) <span class="math">\(\xi\in [a,b]\)</span>.
With <span class="math">\(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f''(\xi)\rightarrow -\infty\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\xi\rightarrow 0\)</span>,
pointing to a potential problem in the size of the error.
Running a test with <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span>, say <span class="math">\(\int_{0.1}^4\sqrt{x}dx\)</span> shows that
the convergence rate is indeed restored to -2.</p>

Write three test functions for the three unit test procedures
described in the section <span class="xref std std-ref">sec:integrals:testprocs</span>. Make sure you
test for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">height</span></code> equal to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">left</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">right</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mid</span></code>. You may
call the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">midpoint</span></code> function for checking the result when <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">height=mid</span></code>.</p>

<span id="sec-exer-adaptive-int"></span><h4>Exercise 38: Adaptive integration<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-38-adaptive-integration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Suppose we want to use the trapezoidal or midpoint method to
compute an integral <span class="math">\(\int_a^b f(x)dx\)</span> with an error less than
a prescribed tolerance <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>. What is the appropriate
size of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we may enter an iterative procedure where
we compare the results produced by <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2n\)</span> intervals,
and if the difference is smaller than <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the value corresponding
to <span class="math">\(2n\)</span> is returned. Otherwise, we halve <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and repeat the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
It may be a good idea to organize your code so that the function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">adaptive_integration</span></code> can be used
easily in future programs you write.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Write a function</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>adaptive_integration(f, a, b, eps, method=midpoint)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>that implements the idea above (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eps</span></code> corresponds to the tolerance
<span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">method</span></code> can be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">midpoint</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trapezoidal</span></code>).</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
Easing the answers to the whole of this exercise, as well as preparing for easy use of
adaptive integration in future programs, we organize the
coding of tasks <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> into one file, making it a module.
The code then reads:</p>

<p><strong>b)</strong>
Test the method on <span class="math">\(\int_0^2x^2dx\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\int_0^2\sqrt{x}dx\)</span>
for <span class="math">\(\epsilon = 10^{-1}, 10^{-10}\)</span> and write out the exact error.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
See the code above. Note that, in our suggested code, it is foreseen
that the programmer switches between the two epsilon values by use of commenting, i.e.
adding/removing <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></code>. This may of course be avoided, if desirable, by asking the user for epsilon.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
Make a plot of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> versus <span class="math">\(\epsilon \in [10^{-1}, 10^{-10}]\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(\int_0^2\sqrt{x}dx\)</span>. Use logarithmic scale for <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
From Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-adaptintegr"><span class="std std-ref">Showing n as a function of log(eps) when  is computed by the midpoint (blue) and the trapezoidal (red) method</span></a>, we see that the stricter the value of epsilon, the larger the
difference between the midpoint and the trapezoidal methods. For a given value for epsilon, the
midpoint method comes within the tolerance with fewer intervals (lower value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">n</span></code>) than does
the trapezoidal method. This should be expected, since the midpoint method is somewhat more accurate
than the trapezoidal method.</p>

<h3>Remarks<a class="headerlink" href="#remarks-6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The type of method explored in this exercise is called <em>adaptive</em>,
because it tries to adapt the value of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to meet a given
error criterion. The true error can very seldom be computed
(since we do not know the exact answer to the computational
problem), so one has to find other indicators of the error, such
as the one here where the changes in the integral value, as
the number of intervals is doubled, is taken to reflect the error.</p>

<span id="sec-exer-integrate-x2x"></span><h4>Exercise 39: Integrating x raised to x<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-39-integrating-x-raised-to-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Consider the integral</p>
<div class="math">
\[I = \int_0^4 x^x\,dx\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>The integrand <span class="math">\(x^x\)</span> does not have an anti-derivative that can be expressed in terms of standard functions (visit <a class="reference external" href="http://wolframalpha.com">http://wolframalpha.com</a> and type
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">integral(x**x,x)</span></code> to convince yourself that
our claim is right. Note that Wolfram alpha does give you an answer, but that answer is an approximation, it is <em>not</em> exact. This is because
Wolfram alpha too uses numerical methods to arrive at the answer, just as you will in this exercise). Therefore, we are forced to compute the integral by numerical methods. Compute a result that is right to four digits.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>

</div>
<p>Remember that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">adaptive_integration</span></code> prints out the computed integral, so no effort
in that respect is required here.</p>
<p>Running the program, gives a printout to the screen showing how <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diff</span></code> gets smaller and
smaller each time. The final two lines of the printout read:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>The integral computes to: 2.83384395958
Sufficient n is: 256
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The computed value may be compared to what Wolfram alpha gives. Remember that since we
have not computed the exact error, we can <em>not</em> guarantee that the
&#8220;result is right to four digits&#8221;. However, we have reason to believe that we &#8220;are close&#8221;.
Typically, when it is known that the error measure used is not precise, the tolerance is
made stricter.</p>

<p>This is a continuation of <a class="reference internal" href="._pylight003.html#nd-exer-fitsines"><span class="std std-ref">Exercise 28: Fit sines to straight line</span></a>. The task is to
approximate a given function <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span> on <span class="math">\([-\pi,\pi]\)</span> by a sum of sines,</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto4">
\[\tag{28}
S_N(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} b_n \sin(nt)\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>We are now interested in computing the unknown coefficients <span class="math">\(b_n\)</span>
such that <span class="math">\(S_N(t)\)</span> is in some sense the <em>best approximation</em> to <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span>.
One common way of doing this is to first set up a general expression
for the <em>approximation error</em>, measured by &#8220;summing up&#8221; the
squared deviation of <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span> from <span class="math">\(f\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[E = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>We may view <span class="math">\(E\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(b_1,\ldots,b_N\)</span>. Minimizing <span class="math">\(E\)</span>
with respect to <span class="math">\(b_1,\ldots,b_N\)</span> will give us a <em>best approximation</em>,
in the sense that we adjust <span class="math">\(b_1,\ldots,b_N\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span> deviates
as little as possible from <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Minimization of a function of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> variables, <span class="math">\(E(b_1,\ldots,b_N)\)</span> is
mathematically performed by requiring all the partial derivatives
to be zero:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_1} &amp; = 0,\\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_2} &amp; = 0,\\
&amp;\vdots\\
\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_N} &amp; = 0\thinspace .\end{split}\]</div>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Compute the partial derivative <span class="math">\(\partial E/\partial b_1\)</span> and
generalize to the arbitrary case <span class="math">\(\partial E/\partial b_n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(1\leq n\leq N\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_1}  = \frac{\partial}{\partial b_1} (\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}(S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt),                 \nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[= \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial b_1}((S_N(t)-f(t))^2dt),                 \nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[= 2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(t)dt,                                           \nonumber\]</div>
<p>where it has been assumed that the integrand is such that the partial derivative can be moved inside the integration.</p>
<p>We see that the partial derivative of <span class="math">\(E\)</span> with respect to any one of the <span class="math">\(b\)</span> coefficients will take on the same form, meaning that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_n} = 2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(nt)dt,              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(1\leq n\leq N\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
Show that</p>
<div class="math">
\[b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)\sin(nt)\,dt\thinspace .\]</div>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
Requiring</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial E}{\partial b_n} = 0,              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>means that the following must apply,</p>
<div class="math">
\[2\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (S_N(t)-f(t))\sin(nt)dt = 0.              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>This may be rewritten as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} S_N(t)\sin(nt)dt = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t)\sin(nt)dt              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>or, if we insert the expression for <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span>, we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} (\sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i \sin(it))\sin(nt)dt = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t)\sin(nt)dt,              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>where the summation variable in <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span> has been changed from <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, avoiding conflict with the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> already present in <span class="math">\(\sin(nt)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, since</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin^2(nt)dt = \pi,              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>while</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sin(it)\sin(nt)dt = 0,              \nonumber\]</div>
<p>when <span class="math">\(i \neq n\)</span>, we arrive at</p>
<div class="math">
\[b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)\sin(nt)\,dt\thinspace .\]</div>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
Write a function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">integrate_coeffs(f,</span> <span class="pre">N,</span> <span class="pre">M)</span></code> that computes <span class="math">\(b_1,\ldots,b_N\)</span>
by numerical integration, using <span class="math">\(M\)</span> intervals in the trapezoidal rule.</p>

<p><strong>d)</strong>
A remarkable property of the trapezoidal rule is that it is exact for integrals
<span class="math">\(\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\sin nt\,dt\)</span> (when subintervals are of equal size). Use this
property to create a function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test_integrate_coeff</span></code> to verify the
implementation of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">integrate_coeffs</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
See code given above.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>
Implement the choice <span class="math">\(f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}t\)</span> as a Python function
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(t)</span></code> and call <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">integrate_coeffs(f,</span> <span class="pre">3,</span> <span class="pre">100)</span></code> to see what the
optimal choice of <span class="math">\(b_1, b_2, b_3\)</span> is.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
See code given above. Running the script produces a printout of the following values
for the <span class="math">\(b\)</span> coefficients:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre> 0.63641032

Make a function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot_approx(f,</span> <span class="pre">N,</span> <span class="pre">M,</span> <span class="pre">filename)</span></code> where you plot <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(t)</span></code>
together with the best approximation <span class="math">\(S_N\)</span> as computed above,
using <span class="math">\(M\)</span> intervals for numerical integration. Save the plot to a file
with name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filename</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
See code given above.</p>
<p><strong>g)</strong>
Run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot_approx(f,</span> <span class="pre">N,</span> <span class="pre">M,</span> <span class="pre">filename)</span></code> for <span class="math">\(f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}t\)</span>
for <span class="math">\(N=3,6,12,24\)</span>. Observe how the approximation improves.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
See code given above. Running the program will produce one plot (Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-s-n3"><span class="std std-ref">The function  and its approximation  when </span></a>, Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-s-n6"><span class="std std-ref">The function  and its approximation  when </span></a>, Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-s-n12"><span class="std std-ref">The function  and its approximation  when </span></a> and Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-s-n24"><span class="std std-ref">The function  and its approximation  when </span></a>) for each value of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. We see from the plots that the larger the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, the better the approximation.</p>

Observe a fundamental problem: regardless of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S_N(-\pi)=0\)</span>, not

<span id="sec-exer-trapezoidal-2d"></span><h4>Exercise 42: Derive the trapezoidal rule for a double integral<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-42-derive-the-trapezoidal-rule-for-a-double-integral" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Use ideas in the section <span class="xref std std-ref">sec:int:double:midpoint</span> to derive a formula
for computing a double integral <span class="math">\(\int_a^b\int_c^d f(x,y)dydx\)</span> by the
trapezoidal rule.  Implement and test this rule.</p>
<p><strong>Solution.</strong>
We introduce a help function <span class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> and write</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx = \int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Next, we apply the trapezoidal rule (<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-integrals-trap"><span class="std std-ref">The composite trapezoidal rule</span></a>) to each of the integrals</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b g(x)dx,\quad
g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Starting with <span class="math">\(g(x)=\int_c^d f(x,y)dy\)</span>, we introduce
<span class="math">\(n_y\)</span> intervals on <span class="math">\([c,d]\)</span> with length <span class="math">\(h_y\)</span>. The trapezoidal rule
for this integral then becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[g(x) = \int_c^d f(x,y) dy \approx  h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(x,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x,d) \right],\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math">\(y_j = c + jh_y\)</span>.
For the outer integral <span class="math">\(\int_a^b g(x)dx\)</span>, we get:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b g(x)dx \approx h_x \left[\frac{1}{2}g(a) + \sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1}g(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}g(b) \right],
\quad x_i=a + ih_x\thinspace .\]</div>
<p>Combining the formulas, we get the <em>composite trapezoidal method
for a double integral</em>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) dydx \approx
h_x \biggl[\frac{1}{2}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(a,c) +
\sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(a,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(a,d) \right]\right) + \nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\quad \sum_{i=1}^{n_x-1}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_i,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(x_i,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_i,d) \right]\right)+\nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\quad \frac{1}{2}\left(h_y \left[\frac{1}{2}f(b,c) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_y-1}f(b,y_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(b,d) \right]\right) \biggr]\nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[=
